RR1,Rodent Research 1 (SpaceX-4),"This important first mission in NASA's rodent research project launched in 2014. It proved that the hardware system was effective and safe to use in space, and that critical research operations could be carried out by the space station crew. This first study showed that mice transported on the SpaceX Dragon capsule, then living in the habitat on the space station for a month, were both healthy and active. Rodent Research-1 also included a CASIS commercial research investigation dedicated to the study of muscle loss, or atrophy.",https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/rodent_research_complete
RR3,Rodent Research 3 (SpaceX-8),"For the third mission, launched in 2016, CASIS formed a commercial partnership with the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company, of Indianapolis, Indiana. Their goal was to evaluate a potential new treatment for skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. Working with NASA, the researchers assessed its ability to prevent these conditions in mice exposed to long-duration spaceflight. Rodent research models have made it possible to study serious diseases involving muscle atrophy, and even age-related weakness. Conducting this study during spaceflight provided the researchers with the rare opportunity to expose all the muscles of an organism to conditions that will produce atrophy - something not easily achieved on Earth.",https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/rodent_research_3
RR4,Rodent Research 4 (SpaceX-10),"Rodent Research on the International Space Station (ISS) continues with the fourth mission launching aboard SpaceX-10. The science on Rodent Research-4 is sponsored by the Department of Defense (DoD) Space Test Program and the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), manager of the ISS National Laboratory. The primary objectives are to better understand bone healing and bone tissue regeneration and to study the impacts of microgravity on these processes. Experiment results may help to evaluate the practicality of growing complex bone tissues in spaceflight as well as study the effects of microgravity on bone density.",https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-4-spacex-10
RR5,Rodent Research 5 (SpaceX-11),"The topic of study on this mission was bone tissue loss - a challenge for the health of astronauts, as well as for people on Earth suffering from osteoporosis. For the experiment, a group of mice was launched to the space station in June 2017. Half of them returned to Earth one month later, while the other half remained in space for a full two months. This allowed the researchers - a team based at University of California, Los Angeles - to study the effects of a potential treatment for bone loss, and how the body readapts to Earth conditions after an extended stay in microgravity.",https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=2017
RR6,Rodent Research 6 (SpaceX-13),"The topic of muscle wasting, or atrophy, was studied in Rodent Research-6. This is a problem for astronauts, brought on by microgravity, and also for many patients on Earth in different situations of disease or limited exercise. Working with NASA and CASIS, researchers from the pharmaceutical company Novartis, NanoMedical Systems and Houston Methodist Research Institute evaluated a new system for administering a drug that might be able to counteract this effect. A tiny chip, implanted under the skin, delivers a constant, low dose of the drug being tested, helping also to avoid the known side effects of its long-term use at high doses.",https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-6-spacex-13
RR7,Rodent Research 7 (SpaceX-15),"Whole communities of microorganisms live on and in our bodies, and they play an important role in human health. Known collectively as the microbiome, these communities are likely to be affected by the unique conditions of space, including microgravity. Rodent Research-7 looked at how the reduced-gravity environment of the International Space Station affects the community of microorganisms in the gut and what impact this has on multiple systems in the body. The results will show scientists how they might create solutions to keep astronauts safe and healthy on long-duration spaceflight missions and improve the treatment of gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic and sleep disorders on Earth.",https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-7
RR8,Rodent Research 8,,
RR9,Rodent Research 9 (SpaceX-12),"The spaceflight environment is known to result in significant physiological changes on many aspects of the body during long-duration mission in low Earth orbit, posing hazards to the astronauts.  This mission’s primary objective is to use mice to better understand the visual impairment and joint tissue degradation that are affecting astronauts living in space for long periods of time, and to examine possible ways to counteract those health problems.  NASA is also working to maximize science return from this mission by sharing tissues from the animals with as many NASA investigators as possible.",https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-9
RR12,Rodent Research 12 (NG-11),The Rodent Research Mission (RR-12) is targeted to fly to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard NG-11 in April 2019. RR-12 will study the immune system of mice in space by examining their bodies’ response to tetanus vaccinations. The immune system of mice closely parallels that of humans. The information gathered from RR-12 will be helpful in understanding how to maintain the health and well-being of astronauts during long duration spaceflights.,https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-12-ng-11
RR17,Rodent Research 17 (SpaceX-18),"RR-17 uses younger and older mice as model organisms to evaluate the physiological, cellular and molecular effects of the spaceflight environment. Some responses to spaceflight in humans and model organisms such as mice resemble accelerated aging. This investigation provides a better understanding of aging-related immune, bone, and muscle disease processes, which may lead to new therapies for use in space and on Earth.",
RR19,Mighty Mice in Space (Rodent Research 19),"Mighty Mice in Space: Preclinical Evaluation of a Broad Spectrum Myostatin Inhibitor to Prevent Muscle and Bone Loss Due to Disuse (Rodent Research-19) investigates targeting myostatin (MSTN) and activin to prevent skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight, and enhance recovery following return to Earth. Myostatin and activin are molecular signaling pathways that influence muscle degradation. This research could provide valuable data to support clinical trials for MSTN therapies for a wide range of conditions that affect muscle and bone health.",https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=8075
